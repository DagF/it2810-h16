## Time used

|Task|Time|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Init|15 min|Created git repo for the course and configured WebStorm to work with VCS|
|Crafting website idea|6min|I looked up what others had done with the theme "Things to be thankful for in life". I mostly found lists like "60 Things to Be Grateful For In Life", with everything from coffee to your parents. I figured what a student could need is a personalised website where he can add all the things he are grateful for and could be used as a start page to give him motivation. |
|Added js and css files|6min||
|Favicon|20min|Created a multi resolution one with GIMP following this guide: http://thenewcode.com/467/Creating-Multi-Resolution-Favicons-For-Web-Pages-With-GIMP|
|Added functionality to add a image|50min|Had to go a bit fancy and let the user select sizes|
|Added styling for multiple things|15min|Used flexbox to add styling to make multiple objects not look to bad|
